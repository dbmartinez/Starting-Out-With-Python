# Algorithm
# 1. Calculate a vehicles distance going 70 mph
# 2. Display travel in 6 hours
# 3. Display travel in 10 hours
# 4. Display travel in 15 hours
# 5. Display results

# Variables
speed = 70
time1 = 6
time2 = 10
time3 = 15

# Calculation
distance1 = speed * time1
distance2 = speed * time2
distance3 = speed * time3

# Display results
print("\nDistance the car will travel in 6 hours: ", distance1)
print("Distance the car will travel in 10 hours: ", distance2)
print("Distance the car will travel in 15 hours: ", distance3)
